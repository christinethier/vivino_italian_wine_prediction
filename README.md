# Predicting Ratings of Italian Red Wines Using the Vivino Social Network

This repository illustrates the code for an examproject focused on predicting ratings on Vivino for italian red wines .

The project incorporates the following algorithms:

- Webscraping 
- Data Sctructuring
- Data Analysis
- Simple Machine Learning models as Linear regression, Ridge regression, Lasso regression and Elastic Net.

This project revolves around the research objective of finding the most accurate machine learning model to predict the ratings of Italian red wines by utilising the userbased data scraped from the Vivino social network. 

Using machine learning modelling the paper presents a model that leverages off Vivinoâ€™s publicly available data and can be utilised by e.g. a wholesaler or winery to predict the rating score of a red Italian wine with certain characteristics such as price, taste characteristic, year and region. While Vivino has already facilitated a marketplace for wineries to sell their wines to consumers, one could imagine that the individual winery would find it difficult to find the most optimal price to sell their wines. By utilising the machine learning model, the individual winery would be able to find optimal prices for their wines that maximises the rating by varying the input price given certain wine characteristics. The idea behind the project is to showcase how the increasing tendency of sharing of knowledge and recommendations in social networks can enable a better understanding of consumer preferences, which can be utilised by businesses as a tool to optimise their prices and in the end maximise profits.
